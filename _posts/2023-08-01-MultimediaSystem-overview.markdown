- Advances in human-computer interaction technology   
  - In order to use a computer to handle various information, the computer must be easy and convenient to use.   
  - Technology related to human-computer interaction is needed to make computers more convenient and easy to use.   
  - Today's Computers   
    - Provides various user-friendly interfaces.   
<br />
- Human Computer Interaction (HCI) technology   
  - Multimedia data is diverse and has a large capacity, so it is not easy for general users to search for information.   
  - HCI technology aims to improve the interaction between humans and computers easily and conveniently by enabling interactive manipulation of multimedia data input, processing, and control.   
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI) technology   
      - Interface with graphics technology to provide user convenience   
      - Supports better user interaction using GUI technology.   
    - Voice recognition technology, gesture recognition technology, etc.   
<br />
- Advances in information and communication technology   
  - Generating multimedia data requires a lot of money and time.   
  - Therefore, sharing multimedia information is very important in terms of efficiency and economics.   
    - There are limits to storing and sharing multimedia data using storage media.   
    - Therefore, the development of information and communication networks for data transmission is essential for multimedia utilization.   
  - Most areas of multimedia use take place in the internet environment.   
    - Interactive internet shopping, online games, video on demand, video conferencing, telemedicine, virtual university, etc.   
  - Ultimately, the development of information and communication networks is essential for the use of multimedia.   
    - In particular, the establishment of a high-speed information and communication network is very important.   
   
<br />
### Characteristics of multimedia   
   
- ① Digitalization of information: Multimedia data needs to be digitized for use on computers.   
- ② Integration of information: Use integrated multimedia data to effectively convey information.   
- ③ Interaction of information: Organize data in the desired form to suit individual user needs.   
- ④ Sharing of information: The Internet eliminates the monopoly on information and creates an open, interconnected form of knowledge.   
   
#### Digitalization of information   
   
- In order for multimedia to be processed on computers, the information must be digitized.   
<br />
- Digitization   
  - Converting analog signals such as images or sounds into digital form for use as input to a computer.   
<br />
- Advantages of digitalization   
  - Easier to process and edit data than when it exists as analog data.   
  - Prevent data quality deterioration due to data transmission or output.   
  - Because it exists as digital data, random access is possible, making it easy to search for desired data.   
   
#### Integration of information   
   
- The ability to deliver dynamic information by integrating various types of media   
  - In the past, text, images, sounds, and videos were only available on each dedicated device.   
  - Recently, thanks to multimedia data information processing technology, various types of information can be stored and manipulated simultaneously through a single software or device.   
  - Therefore, it is possible to deliver information to users much more effectively by integrating a wide range of multimedia data such as graphics, audio, video, and text.   
   
#### Interaction of information   
   
- Characteristics that create data in the form desired by the user to suit the needs of individual users   
  - Video On Demand (VOD)   
  - Music On Demand (MOD)   
  - Game On Demand (GOD)   
  - News On Demand (NOD)   
  - Internet Protocal Television (IPTV)   
    - It additionally provides Internet services such as information search, shopping, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) that were previously available on the web, or on-demand video services.   
   
#### Sharing of information   
   
- Multimedia information is shared by many users on the Internet.   
  - Search sites and portals   
    - By gathering a vast amount of data and providing it in one bundle, many users can gather and share information.   
  - Development of the World Wide Web (WWW: Web for short)   
    - The concept of information sharing is becoming more widespread.   
<br />
- Tim Berners-Lee   
  - Defining today's web as Web 2.0.   
  - Web 2.0: It is a user-centered Internet environment that allows anyone to easily create data and share it on the Internet without the owner or monopolist of the data.   
   
<br />
### Multimedia content   
   
#### Definition of multimedia content   
   
- Various information or contents produced and processed by digitizing multimedia data such as text, sound, and images   
<br />
- e.g.   
  - Various programs or information provided on the Internet   
  - Movies or music on video tapes or CDs   
  - Publications such as electronic publishing   
  - Videos such as movies or advertisements   
  - Various games and multimedia services provided online or through networks, etc.   
   
#### Characteristics of multimedia content   
   
- Digital data   
  - While existing content is mainly analog, multimedia content consists of digital data.   
- Interaction of information   
  - Users and information providers exchange information in two directions, that is, they tend to be prosumers.   
- Relaxation of space and time constraints   
  - Due to the development of the Internet, restrictions on time and space have been eased, allowing for the expansion of information.   
- Non-linear access to information   
  - Rather than receiving information sequentially like reading a book, the acquisition of information becomes non-linear depending on each individual's ability, so the path to acquiring information becomes diverse.   
   
#### Types of multimedia Content   
   
- Content for information provision, education, promotion, entertainment, etc.   
- Cultural content, the meeting of culture and information technology   
- Content that promotes interaction with users, etc.   
<br />
- Content viewed through content structure   
  - Informational content, educational content, promotional content, entertainment content, etc.   
<br />
- Cultural content   
  - Content that digitizes cultural elements such as art, design, humanities and social sciences based on creativity and technology   
<br />
- Content for interaction   
  - Content that allows interaction with users can have the effect of arousing user interest and encouraging participation.   
   
#### Multimedia content production   
   
- Very similar to making a movie or game.   
- In order to successfully produce multimedia content,   
  - Development staff made up of experts,   
  - A perfect production process tailored to the production purpose is required.   
<br />
- Production team members   
  - Project manager: Overall management and execution   
  - Project designer: Performs technical aspects of the project   
  - Content expert: Performs everything from storyboard to content creation   
  - Programmer: Completes prepared contents into products using S/W, etc.   
  - Copywriter: Prepare text for the project   
  - Graphic designer: Prepare graphics for visual effects of the product   
<br />
- Production process   
  - ① Design stage   
  - ② Requirements and structural design stage   
  - ③ Storyboard stage   
  - ④ Content production stage   
  - ⑤ Authoring stage   
  - ⑥ Evaluation stage   
  - ⑦ Distribution stage
