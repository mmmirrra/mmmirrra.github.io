## World Wide Web   
   
<br />
### Overview of the Web   
   
#### World Wide Web   
   
- Abbreviated as Web.   
- An information system or information space that allows access to and sharing of numerous sites and information that are connected like a spider's web through the Internet, anytime, anywhere.   
- An information service that uses the HTML format to express documents in hypertext format so that various information on the Internet can be effectively searched, and has an HTTP communication protocol to transmit them.   
   
#### Internet   
   
- All networks connected using a transmission protocol called TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol).   
- The development of web services in 1989 provided an opportunity to use the Internet.   
- The early Internet provided text information using a keyboard.   
- The Internet was revitalized in 1993 with the development of the mouse and a web browser called Mosaic.   
   
#### Web Browser   
   
- An application used to search for information on the Internet   
- A program that connects to a server, reads hypertext documents made available on an HTTP server, and displays them on the computer in use.   
- A web browser is a multimedia search program that supports not only text and images but also videos, music, and games in web services, enabling the search, storage, and transmission of specific data.   
   
<br />
### The evolution of the web   
   
- Changes in the Internet environment and activation of the use of various multimedia information through the Internet   
  - Development of the first distributed multimedia hypertext system for information exchange on the Internet (1989, Tim Berners-Lee, CERN Laboratory, Switzerland, etc.)   
  - At the time of development, users had different platforms, so sending and receiving information was not smooth.   
- 1993 Development of Mosaic, a GUI-based web browser.   
  - Multimedia information can be received regardless of platform.   
  - Afterwards, browsers with various functions were developed.   
- Web-related technologies were developed by the Web Consortium (W3C).   
  - Established in 1994 led by Tim Berners-Lee.   
  - Aims for web interoperability.   
<br />
- Mosaic   
  - Developed by Marc Lowell Andreessen et al. of NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications).   
   
<br />
### Hypermedia and the web   
   
- Hypertext   
  - Text-based documents are linked through links.   
  - Pieces of information, such as documents or web pages, are read from a web server through a web browser and displayed on the monitor.   
  - Users follow hyperlinks on each page to move to other documents or to the server that serves the page.   
<br />
- Hypermedia   
  - Information including not only text but also images, video, and sound are linked together through links.   
<br />
- To view hypertext or hypermedia information.   
  - A web browser is required to locate and reproduce the information.   
  - A good browser should be easily usable by a large number of users and provide smooth information search functions.   
   
<br />
### Types of web browsers   
   
- Mosaic   
  - First web browser   
- Internet Explorer (IE)

  - Web 2.0 uses standardized protocols.   
    - Allow end users to use site data in other places, such as other websites, independent PCs, etc.   
  - Protocols for syndication are all based on XML.   
  - Representative protocols include RSS, Atom, etc.   
   
#### Web 2.0 technologies and applications   
   
- RSS (Really Simple Syndication, Rich Site Summary)   
  - An XML-based representation format for exchanging content between frequently updated websites.   
  - A method of expressing content mainly used in news or blogs.   
  - Information is updated through RSS feeds without accessing the site.   
  - Used for media distribution purposes such as PodCasting.   
- Social Tagging   
  - A technique in which users attach keywords to random tags and search for them.   
    - In the case of existing web searches, a directory-based search method classifies and searches data according to predetermined categories.   
  - Tags freely added by users are labeled as is and the information is classified.   
  - Since tags can be attached to data as many times as desired, searching using tags can search for a variety of contents.   
  - Representative services using tags   
    - Social bookmarking site: Delicious (del.icio.us)   
    - Online photo sharing community site: Flickr   
- Mashups with public APIs

    - XFN (XHTML Friends Network)   
      - A means of expressing human relationships using hyperlinks   
      - Blogs provide a way to express relationships with others.   
   
#### Web 2.0 services   
   
- Evolution of search services   
  - Search service: Service for information search provided by the communication network   
  - Search engine: Software system for information retrieval   
    - Search services provided through multiple search engines have dramatically improved with Google's introduction of the Page rank concept.   
      - Page rank   
        - Search technology developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Stanford University

## Web page using multimedia   
   
- Web page   
  - A web page is a representation of a web document on the Internet.   
  - Web pages are created using HTML.   
  - The web page is   
    - Consists of various text, images, sounds, video files, etc.   
    - A hyperlink function is required to enable linking with other documents on the Internet.   
    - The function of the hyperlink is highlighted, underlined, or expressed in blue, etc.   
   
<br />
## Expression of web page documents using HTML   
   
<br />
### Overview of HTML   
   
- Development of the Internet ⇒ The role of the web is a decisive factor.   
  - Core elements of the web ⇒ Development of HTML   
   
#### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)   
   
- A markup language for writing web pages   
- It indicates the structural meaning for the text of a web document, such as titles, paragraphs, and lists, and provides a way to create structured documents with links, citations, and other items.   
- First proposed by Tim Berners-Lee.   
- Starting with version 1.0 in 1992, the W3C's recommendation HTML 4.01 was distributed in 1999, and the draft of HTML5 was distributed in 2008.   
- HTML is based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language).   
- Characteristics of general documents despite being a hypertext language.   
<br />
- How HTML differs from Word documents   
  - HTML is written using the `＜ ＞` tags.   
  - The [Spacebar], [Enter], and [Tab] keys are not recognized.   
  - HTML documents must be saved as text documents, and when saving, the extension of `*.htm` or `*.html` must be used.   
  - Does not distinguish between upper and lower case letters.   
   
<br />
### Examples of HTML composition and use   
   
#### Structure of HTML document   
   
- HTML uses markup tags that specify the expressive form of a word or sentence.   
- Expressed by inserting a word indicating the attribute in the tag symbol `＜ ＞`.   
- Therefore, the document structure largely consists of two parts.   
  - The part surrounded by the HEAD tag   
  - The part surrounded by the BODY tag   
- The entire document is surrounded by HTML tags.   
   
  ```html
  <!-- Entire document (HTML tags) -->
  <HTML>
      <!-- Head (HEAD tag) -->
      <HEAD>
          <TITLE>Welcome</TITLE>
      </HEAD>
      <!-- Body part (BODY tag) -->
      <BODY>
          <!-- Greetings -->
          <H1>Hello?</H1>
      </BODY>
  </HTML>
  ```
   
#### Tag basic configuration   
   
- HTML tag   
  - Tags located at the beginning and end of an HTML document.   
  - HTML tags use both an opening tag (`<HTML>`) and a closing tag (`</HTML>`).   
  - It is simply a tag that indicates the beginning and end of a document, has no special function, and does not affect the structure or nature of the entire document.   
- HEAD tag   
  - All tags that provide information related to the document are within the HEAD tag.   
  - Use before BODY tag.   
  - May include related tags such as TITLE tag, BASE tag, and META tag.   
- BODY tag   
  - All unused tags exist within the HEAD tag.   
  - In other words, it includes tags that modify the document and its contents.   
    - Tags that handle font size or color, sentence tags that handle paragraphs of sentences, IMG tags that handle images, connection tags that function as hyperlinks, etc.   
   
#### HTML usage example   
   
- Creation of HTML documents   
  - Use a general text editor: Specify 'htm' or 'html' when saving.   
  - Use web authoring tools that support WYSIWYG.   
   
<br />
### Hyperlinks   
   
- Hyperlinks allow you to move to the desired location within a hypertext document.   
- In other words, you can specify a specific location for text, image, sound, and video material.   
  - Created by the `<A>` tag, and specify the address of the place you want to go using the 'href' attribute.   
  - If the linking address is another website, it begins with `http://`, which is the complete URL.   
   
<br />
## Use of multimedia data in web pages   
   
<br />
### Use of images   
   
```html
<IMG src="URL where the image file is located" alt="Description of the image">
```
   
- Specify URL using attribute src with IMG tag.   
- If the image is not visible, use alt to find information or description of the image.   
- Properties such as align, border, height, width, etc.   
- Common image file formats used on web pages are `JPEG` and `GIF`.   
   
<br />
### EMBED tags   
   
- EMBED tags are used to insert multimedia elements into web pages.   
<br />
- Example use of sound   
   
   ```html
   <EMBED src="URL containing sound file">
   ```
   
- Example use of video   
   
  ```html
  <EMBED src="URL containing video file">
  ```
   
#### Examples of animation use   
   
- When using animated GIF: Use the `<IMG>` tag.   
- When using flash: Use the `<EMBED>` tag.   
- When using a Java applet: Use the `<APPLET>` tag.   
   
<br />
## Other web document standards   
   
<br />
### SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)   
   
- Established as an international standard as a technical markup language by ISO in 1986.   
- Every document consists of three parts.: Header file, document type definition (DTD), and body   
  - Procedural markup language   
    - A language to describe matters pertaining to the format of text appearing in a message.   
    - Disadvantages limited to specific editing systems or application environments.   
  - Technical markup language   
    - A language that describes what the content of the document element being formatted is.   
    - Rather than describing the process of document processing, it describes the logical structure and properties of the document.   
    - Therefore, it is not limited to a specific editing system or application environment.   
- It is an international standard as a meta-language that can define the structure of a document, but it is not widely used because its functions are complex.   
- Provides basis for HTML and XML.   
   
<br />
### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)   
   
- XML is an extensible markup language.   
- Designed in text format so that structured literature can be transmitted on the web.   
  - It is a solution to overcome the limitations of existing HTML and solve the complexity of SGML.   
  - It is a standard that adds the ability for users to define new tags in HTML.   
   
#### Advantages of XML   
   
- Independent of device and system.   
  - Can be used in a variety of software and hardware.   
- Very clear.   
  - This is because the number of selection techniques is small and there is no tag minimization that causes tag omission.   
- XML allows users to create their own tags.   
- Documents can be displayed in a variety of ways.   
- Independent of specific language.   
  - Can be used without restrictions on language or country.   
   
<br />
### DHTML (Dynamic HTML)   
   
- DHTML is a technology that turns the static documents of existing HTML into dynamic and lively web pages.   
  - A technology that objectifies all components of a web document and then dynamically displays them through a script language.   
   
#### Script language   
   
- A language that describes the characteristics or behavior of an object   
- While simple and easy to use, it is not suitable for creating independent, complex applications.   
- Content consisting of simple text, such as a web page, can achieve various effects by using a script language.   
<br />
- Scripting languages ​​used in web pages include.   
  - JavaScript   
  - VB Script   
  - J-Script   
  - etc.   
   
<br />
## Web page authoring tools   
   
- Web authoring tool   
  - A program that helps you create web pages more easily and conveniently.   
  - Also called HTML editor.   
  - Most authoring tools provide WYSIWYG functionality.   
<br />

  - Language specifications are a subset of Java.   
- Enables users to provide the information they want with dynamic functions.   
  - HTML consists of tags that unilaterally provide information to the user.   
- It is inserted into an HTML document to create an interactive web document.   
   
<br />
### DHTML   
   
- A technique for creating interactive, interactive web pages by combining HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, a style definition language.   
<br />
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)   
  - Standard for representing style sheets on web pages   
<br />
- Style sheet   
  - A collection of style rules that specify the style of a document.   
  - The style and logical structure of the document can be separated, allowing various styles, such as location and color, to be given to web page components.   
   
<br />
### CGI (Common Gateway Interface)   
   
- CGI is a method or protocol for exchanging information between a web server and an external program.   
- Used when creating interactive web pages, such as when the browser sends a query to a database server via the server.   
- Standard way to run external programs   
  - Advantages: Easy to use.   
  - Disadvantage: A burden on the server as it performs many programs on the server.   
   
<br />
### Flash   
   
- Web authoring tool for creating interactive vector-based websites.   
- It is used on many websites because of its fast speed and smooth graphical representation.   
- Unlike GIF or JPEG, which support raster format animation, Flash files are concise, efficient, and designed to be optimized for transmission.   
   
<br />
### VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language)   
   
- A language for describing three-dimensional image scenes that enable user interaction   
- Visual images can be created and placed on web pages so that users can interact with 3D scenes by viewing, moving, and rotating them.   
- A VRML viewer or browser is required to view VRML files.
