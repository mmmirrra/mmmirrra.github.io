  - A disk with a diameter of 12 cm and a storage capacity of about 650 MB   
  - A semi-permanent medium that stores signals by carving a groove in a thin aluminum film with a laser and reads the signals with a laser, so there is no damage to the data   
  - Recently, with the spread of DVDs with large storage capacity, they are used as an inexpensive content distribution medium rather than as a storage device   
<br />
- Types of CDs   
  - CD-R (CD-Recordable)   
    - This is a CD with no data and can only be used once   
  - CD-ROM (CD-Read Only Memory)   
    - As a read-only CD, data cannot be erased or added to   
  - CD-RW (CD-ReWritable)

- Information and communications networks are essential for information exchange through various media   
- Interaction is important for information exchange   
  - Interaction between humans and computers   
    - Realize the conversation environment that users encounter in their daily lives with multimedia processing functions   
  - Human-human interaction   
    - Realize a human conversation environment for remote users through various media   
- Multimedia communication services enable this interaction   
   
#### Definition of multimedia communication services   
   
- Various technologies and products used to comprehensively create, store, transmit, and play multimedia information   
- Providing necessary information interactively through two or more media simultaneously in the same system   
   
#### Communication system for multimedia services   
   
- Advances in optical fiber technology and data compression technology have made it possible to use multimedia services regardless of time and place   
- Multimedia data has a different communication volume and form than existing data, so a new communication system is needed   
- Multimedia communication systems naturally develop in the process of converging individual technologies such as computer, communication, and broadcasting technologies into one through digital technology   
   
#### Communication system using network   
   
- ISDN : Integrated Services Digital Networks   
  - A communication network that comprehensively provides various services such as voice, text, and video through a single communication network
