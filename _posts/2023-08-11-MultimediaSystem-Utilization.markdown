- A variety of data broadcasting services are available and are interactive, including provision of on-demand information through the Internet and computers

#### Overview of digital broadcasting

- Unlike existing analog broadcasting, television broadcasting encodes information signals and compresses and transmits television signals in digital form
<br />
- Analog broadcasting
  - Only one video can be carried on one radio wave, and audio is sent on a different radio wave
- Digital broadcasting
  - Multiple videos, voices, and other data can be transmitted through a single radio wave without compromising broadcast quality
  - More information is transmitted at the same bandwidth frequency using video compression technology
  - Capable of delivering high-definition video and movie-level sound that are 3 to 6 times that of existing TVs

#### Transmission standards for digital broadcasting

- ATSC (Advanced Television System Committee)
  - A terrestrial digital TV transmission method developed in the United States, an advanced form of NTSC
  - Various signal formats allow broadcasting of multiple channels
  - For compression, MPEG-2 is used for video signals, AC-3 is used for sound and voice signals, and VSB (Vestigial Side Band) technology is used for signal transmission
  - While large-capacity information transmission and high-definition quality are possible, reception rates are low in urban areas or mountains where there is a lot of radio interference
  - Method adopted in Korea
<br />
- DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting)
  - A transmission method developed in Europe, a development of the PAL method
  - Cable TV, satellite, terrestrial, and public viewing antennas have high commonality
  - MPEG-2 is the basic encoding and compression of signals
  - While the picture quality is poor, there are few areas of difficult hearing

<br />
### Digital TV

- Digital TV is a television that can play high-quality screens and add various functions by converting incoming broadcast signals into digital codes
- Because it uses digitally compressed and modulated data, it can only be viewed through a receiver or set-top box designed for digital TV
- The picture quality is clearer than analog TV, and the sound quality is at the level of a CD
- There are many channels, giving viewers a wide range of choices.
- The biggest advantage of data broadcasting

#### Types of digital TV

- HD TV (High Definition TV)
  - High definition TV with 16 : 9 wide screen
  - Clear picture quality, less screen shaking, and sufficient color expression are possible
  - Support for digital TV broadcasting in Korea
- SD TV (Standard Definition TV)
  - Digital TV with relatively low resolution
  - Since it occupies less frequency band than HD TV, it is easy to support data broadcasting, simultaneous broadcasting, VOD (video on demand), etc.

#### Advantages and disadvantages of digital TV

- Advantages
  - Clear picture and sound quality
    - Since the modulation and demodulation process is digital, there is no room for noise signals to interfere
  - Multi-channelization
    - Thanks to MPEG-2 technology, about 4 programs can be exported in the same bandwidth
  - Limited reception and scramble function
    - The scramble function allows information to be provided only to specific recipients or regions by applying encryption technology and technology that disrupts radio waves. It can be provided by differentiating the target from paid broadcasting
<br />
- Disadvantages
  - Copyright infringement problem due to unauthorized copying
    - There is concern about copyright infringement because there is no deterioration in picture and sound quality no matter how much copying is done
  - High costs for broadcasting stations and transmission facilities
    - Costs for digital broadcasting ultimately add to the price burden on consumers

<br />
### DMB (Digital Multimedia Broadcasting)

- Broadcasting technology that provides various multimedia services such as video and audio
- Developed for the purpose of mobile multimedia broadcasting that can receive TV, radio, and data broadcasting on portable devices
- Developed based on DAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting), a European digital audio broadcaster
- In 1995, the BBC in the UK began the world's first DAB broadcast
- In Korea
  - DAB was introduced for the purpose of replacing analog radio broadcasting
  - Afterwards, we independently developed DMB technology that can transmit not only voice but also video

#### Terrestrial DMB (T-DMB)

- Terrestrial DMB is a method of transmitting broadcasting programs using frequencies on the ground
  - Program transmission using the frequency band (174 ~ 216 MHz) of VHF channels 7 ~ 13
  - Uses the video format of MPEG-4 Part 10 (H.264) and the audio format of MPEG-4 Part 3 (BSAC) or HE-AAC V2
- In Korea
  - In 2005, the world's first terrestrial DMB broadcast began
  - Approved as an official international standard by ITU along with DVB-H and etc. in 2007
- Compared to satellite DMB
  - Advantage: You can watch broadcasts with clear picture quality even while the vehicle is moving at high speed
  - Disadvantage: The number of channels is small in some hard-to-view areas and areas outside the metropolitan area

#### Satellite DMB (S-DMB)

- A method of transmitting broadcast programs using satellite transmission equipment and terrestrial relay equipment
  - The default bandwidth is 25 MHz in the ultra-high frequency 2.6 GHz band
