  - A place that has nothing to do with people's physical locations, is not limited by time and space, and is interconnected through computers and information and communication networks   
   
#### Development of interactive environmental technology   
   
- Interactive environmental technology was developed in 1969 by Kruger et al   
  - The interactive space records human figures and movements through sensors and video cameras located inside the room   
  - The synthesized image is projected onto all walls in the room   
   
#### Electronic sensory input system   
   
- In 1985, McGreevy and others developed the Virtual Environment Display System   
  - Development of a helmet incorporating an LCD screen   
  - If you wear a helmet, you can watch the same video as the robot is recording from a distant planet   
   
#### Data globe   
   
- Data Globe was developed by Zimmerman et al. at VPL Research in 1987   
  - Data Glove: A device that converts hand and finger movements into electronic signals   
    - Expanding the concept of data globe to develop into data suite   
   
#### Body electric   
   
- Lanier and others at VPL Research developed software called body electric   
  - A program that converts the movement of the data globe and the VPL EyePhone into actions in virtual reality   
   
#### CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment)   
   
- CAVE was developed by Depanti et al. at the University of Illinois in 1991   
- User-immersive projection display with a virtual reality system using vision

### Types of virtual reality   
   
- Immersive virtual reality system   
- Non-immersive virtual reality system   
- Complex virtual reality system   
   
#### Immersive virtual reality system   
   
- A system in which users are immersed in virtual reality   
  - By wearing special equipment such as helmets, data gloves, and data suits, you can immerse yourself in virtual reality by experiencing sensory effects similar to what you actually see and touch   
  - Immersive systems allow users to interact with objects, such as by touching or manipulating them   
   
#### Non-immersive virtual reality system   
   
- A system for experiencing virtual reality using only simple stereoscopic glasses or a joystick using images displayed on a general computer monitor   
- Also called desktop virtual reality system   
   
#### Complex virtual reality system   
   
- ① AR (Augmented Reality)   
  - AR is a technology that superimposes virtual objects on the real world   
  - It is also called MR (Mixed Reality) because it combines the real world with a virtual world with additional information in real time and displays it as a single image   
  - It is also called hybrid VR in the sense of fusing the real environment and the virtual environment   
- ② Remote presence   
  - Tele-existence   
    - Build an environment using virtual reality so that remote objects or people can feel as if they are nearby and perform operations in real time   
  - Tele-robotics   
    - When controlling a robot equipped with a camera to explore and observe places that are actually difficult to reach or are physically distant

### VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language)   
   
- A language for describing three-dimensional graphics scenes that enable user interaction   
  - Established as a web standard by W3C in 1994   
  - Announcement of X3D (eXtensible 3D) based on XML, starting with VRML 1.0   
    - X3D is an extensible 3D graphics protocol that develops the capabilities of VRML   
    - Means integration with XML   
   
#### Features of VRML   
   
- Platform-independent because it is assumed to be used on the web   
- Because it must be transmitted in real time, the file size is small. (ASCII file format)   
- Can also be combined with other documents such as HTML documents or Java   
- Commonly used to create internet shopping malls or virtual schools, etc.   
- The extension is `*.wrl`

### Application of virtual reality   
   
#### Simulation field   
   
- Make simulations as realistic as possible in cyberspace   
  - Flight simulator   
  - NASA VIEW system   
   
#### Telecommunications field   
   
- Remote video conferencing that supports remote presence, etc.   
   
#### Medical field   
   
- Tele-operation using robots   
- Telemedicine system using real-time experience, etc.   
   
#### Other fields   
   
- Robotics field: Remote control using robots   
- Education field: Education using virtual reality technology   
- Entertainment field: Experience games using virtual reality
